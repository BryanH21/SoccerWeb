            <h2>My background</h2>
            <p>I played soccer for many years before becoming a coach. Through my experiences
                as a player, I aim to coach the new generation properly and help them avoid the mistakes I made.  
                I have been a head coach for multiple teams over the past two years and have conducted several  
                additional training sessions with NUSC's Rec+ training program.  
                This year marks my third year as a head coach and my fourth year as a group trainer.  
                I look forward to making significant progress this upcoming spring season,  
                with my focus on continuing to learn and develop my coaching program.

            <h2>Grassroots Licensed</h2>
            <p>Many coaches are experienced, but not all have undergone the proper education and background checks  
                required to provide high-quality coaching. I have completed multiple courses to obtain my Grassroots License,  
                which has provided me with the knowledge to develop my own drills, build effective training plans,  
                and explain concepts in ways that players understand best.

            <h2>Future Plans & Certifications</h2>
            <p>I am always striving to improve, and coaching is no exception.  
                I am currently working on my 11v11 and 7v7 in-person courses,  
                which will qualify me for the D-License, the next step in the US Soccer License Pyramid.  
                I also plan to invest in new equipment to enhance my coaching sessions,  
                allowing players to better understand the concepts being taught.
