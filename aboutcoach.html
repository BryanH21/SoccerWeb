            <h2>My background</h2>
            <p>I played soccer for many years before becoming a coach. Through my experiences
                as a player, I aim to coach the new generation properly and help them avoid the mistakes I made.  
                I have been a head coach for multiple teams over the past two years and have conducted several  
                additional training sessions with NUSC's Rec+ training program.  
                This year marks my third year as a head coach and my fourth year as a group trainer.  
                I look forward to making significant progress this upcoming spring season,  
                with my focus on continuing to learn and develop my coaching program.

            <h2>Multi-Licensed U.S Soccer Coach</h2>
            <p>I have earned both my 11v11 and 7v7 in-person licenses through U.S. Soccer, ensuring I bring a well-rounded and certified coaching approach to the field. These certifications have strengthened my ability to develop drills, build effective training plans, and communicate complex concepts in player-friendly ways.

            <p>I am always striving to improve, and coaching is no exception. I am currently working toward my D-License, the next step in the US Soccer License Pyramid. I also plan to invest in new equipment to enhance my coaching sessions, allowing players to better understand the concepts being taught.
