                    <p>I am passionate about developing youth players and watching them reach their 
                        potential through my program. I played soccer for many years before I became a coach and through my experiences
                        as a player I aim to coach the new generation properly and avoid the mistakes I made.
                        I have been a head coach for many teams over the past 2 years and have had several additional training sessions 
                        with NUSC's Rec+ training program. I am certified through US and Indiana Soccer along with 
                        being grassroots licensed.
