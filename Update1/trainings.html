            <h1>Why Training is Important</h1>
            <p>Most people who have never played soccer will watch the sport and believe the game is simple,
                I always hear the same thing every time "Soccer is so easy its just kicking a ball into a net" in truth 
                while soccer at its fundementals is incredbly basic to become truly great at soccer you must master the basic skills and concepts.
                With my training program you will not only imporve your overall play and skills on the ball but off it too. In fact, some of the most 
                important concpets a player will learn wont even be with the ball but instead what they do without.
            </p>

            <h2>Maximizing Your Training</h2>
            <p>In order to get the most out of my program I always urge consistency over anything else. If players are not consistent in their trainings 
                they will not develop as quickly as their talent might suggest they should. This means while you should show up to as many of the triaings 
                as you can you must also pratice at home, especially the most basic of skills such as juggling. You will see greater imporvement over a very short
                period of time if you take this advice and apply it to your everyday life.

                <h2>Phase One</h2>
                <p>In this drill, we have several areas of focus depending on the position being played.
                    Its a great drill that allows several players the chance to explore their position and learn from mistakes made.
                    This drill starts with the midfielder having the ball, along with a front three composed of two wingers and a striker.
                    The goal of the offense is to break down the defense by being fluid, making runs, dragging defenders out of position,
                    and knowing when to ask for the ball.
                    
                        On the defensive side, their goal is to remain disciplined in their position, know when to press the ball,
                    how to man-mark, which player to follow, and how to stay calm under pressure when outnumbered.

                <h2>Phase Two</h2>
                <p>Second phase of play is the beginning of the drill, where the midfielder passes into the striker 
                   (as shown by the black arrow) who will then pass back to the midfielder (as shown by the red arrow), 
                   beginning the drill.

                <h2>Phase Three</h2>
                <p>The final phase of play is the drill in action. Notice that the midfielder has dribbled into space, looking for passing options.

                    On the left, a winger is ready to make a run behind the fullback, which would be a great through-ball option for the midfielder.
                In the middle, the striker is creating space by pushing up against the center-back, allowing him to either receive a through ball
                for a goal-scoring opportunity or create time for the winger to take a shot on goal.
                
                    Finally, on the right, the right winger is dropping deeper to ask for the ball as an option for the midfielder.
                This drill focuses on a fluid attacking style that provides multiple options while also training defenders on
                their defensive principles in a game-like scenario.
