            <h1>Why Training is Important</h1>
            <p>Most people who have never played soccer will watch the sport and believe the game is simple,
                I always hear the same thing every time "Soccer is so easy its just kicking a ball into a net" in truth 
                while soccer at its fundementals is incredbly basic to become truly great at soccer you must master the basic skills and concepts.
                With my training program you will not only imporve your overall play and skills on the ball but off it too. In fact, some of the most 
                important concpets a player will learn wont even be with the ball but instead what they do without.
            </p>

            <h2>Maximizing Your Training</h2>
            <p>In order to get the most out of my program I always urge consistency over anything else. If players are not consistent in their trainings 
                they will not develop as quickly as their talent might suggest they should. This means while you should show up to as many of the triaings 
                as you can you must also pratice at home, especially the most basic of skills such as juggling. You will see greater imporvement over a very short
                period of time if you take this advice and apply it to your everyday life.
